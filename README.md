Silly little notetaking app, complete WIP.

`app.py` flask app, routing

`models.py` models for db tables

`db.py` create table statements for db

s - static files

s/t - templates

start with `flask --app app run`

No registration page since I don't want anyone to be able to use it, but would be easy enough to add one, just copy the login page for a basic setup.

# TODO
- [ ] Inline search box when transcluding cards/images/files
