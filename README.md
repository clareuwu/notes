Silly little notetaking app, complete WIP.

Made with Flask, htmx, Alpine.js. Uses local sqlite3 db for persistence.

`app.py` flask app, routing, auth/cookie stuff

`models.py` models for db tables, methods for add/query/update etc.

`db.py` create table statements for db

s - static files

s/t - templates

No registration page since I don't want random people to be able to use it, but would be easy enough to add one, just copy the login page for a basic setup.
To add a user manually, just run `create_user` in `app.py`.

# Requirements
`sqlite3` >= 3.38.0
`python3` >= 3.8

# Setup
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python db.py
```

```
python3
import os
os.urandom(16)
```
Put generated bytes in config.py: `SECRET_KEY = 'bytes here'`

# Run
start with `flask --app app run` or `flask --app app --debug run` for auto reloading on file changes
